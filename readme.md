# Software Design and Programming 2017

Welcome to my portfolio for SDP 2017.

# Contents

## Coursework

The coursework directory contains files for courseworks 1 and 2.

Coursework 1 was a Simple Machine Language Interpreter, written in Scala.

Coursework 2 concerned a Virtual Machine employing a number of design patterns.  It was a joint assignment and the commit history appears in the separate shared repo at https://github.com/bbkscala17/cw2-shared

## Exercises

The exercises directory contains all of my class exercises for the module, with one sub directory for each week.

The earlier weeks are mainly concerned with functional programming basics and the later weeks with design patterns.  All are written in Scala.
